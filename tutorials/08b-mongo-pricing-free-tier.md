# 📘 MongoDB Pricing & Free Tier – Tutorial

## 1️⃣ What Is MongoDB Pricing Based On?

MongoDB uses a **usage-based pricing model**, mainly through **MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)**.
You pay depending on:

- Cluster type & size
- Storage used
- Backup usage
- Data transfer
- Additional services (Search, App Services, etc.)

👉 For learning and small projects, **Free Tier (M0)** is more than enough.
